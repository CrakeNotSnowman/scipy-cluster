#summary This page contains a summary of changes in each version.

= What's new in Version 0.1.8 =

  # Arrays with data type other than `float64` (e.g. `float32`, `int`, `bool`) can be passed into any parameter in any function that requires a `double`. Any non-float64 data is copied into a new float64 array. 
  # Lists, tuples, and any other data structure supported by `numpy.asarray` can be passed as any parameter requiring a numpy array. For example, `pdist([[0.0, 3.0, 8.7], [3.4, 9.2, 16.2], [2.2, 3.0, 7.8]])` now processes its input without raising an exception. Internally, the list is converted to a numpy array, which can increase the memory footprint.
  # Boolean distance functions now support passing non-boolean data with the caveat that storing any value other than 0 or 1 will generate meaningless distances for many of the functions.
  # Scipy is no longer required as a dependency! You don't need to install it if you don't need it.

= What's new in Version 0.1.7 =

  # Fixed some errors in the documentation for `median`, `centroid`, and `ward`.
  # Fixed some bugs in predicates `numobs_y`, `numobs_linkage`, and `numobs_dm`.

= What's new in Version 0.1.6 =

  # Fixed a bug introduced in 0.1.6 in pdist where passing boolean observation vectors always generates an exception.
  # Fixed `jaccard_distance` function in `cluster.c`. It was a direct copy of `hamming`.
  # Fixed `pdist('jaccard')` so it invokes the right C distance function.
  # Fixed cluster.c so it compiles on OS X with gcc.

= What's new in Version 0.1.5 =

  # Fixed a bug reported by a user where a `float32` array gets passed to the C function as a `float64` resulting in meaningless results in `pdist`.
  # Fixed a bug involving API changes to fclusterdata. This caused fclusterdata to be completely nonfunctional.
  # A new MSI installer for users with Python 2.5. Please let me know if it works.

= What's new in Version 0.1.4 =

  # Added new `link_color_func` parameter to the `dendrogram` function.
  # Fixed bug in `correlation` and `pdist(..., 'correlation')`.
  # Fixed bug in `dendrogram` when `leaves_list` parameter is used.
  # Added windows installer for Python versions 2.4 and 2.5. Windows users: please let me know if it works.
